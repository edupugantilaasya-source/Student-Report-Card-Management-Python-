This system allows users to:
            Add student report details
            View all student reports
            Search student report by roll number
            Automatically calculate total marks, percentage, and 
            
Features:
➕ Add Student Report
📋 View All Reports
🔍 Search Student Report
📊 Automatic Total & Percentage Calculation
🏆 Grade Calculation
🚪 Exit System

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python

Concepts Used:
Classes and Objects
Constructors (__init__)
Methods
Lists
Conditional Statements
Loops
Menu-driven programming

How the Project Works:
User selects an option from the menu.
When adding a student:
             Roll number
             Name
             Marks for 3 subjects are entered.

75 – 89	A
60 – 74	B
50 – 59	C
Below 50	Fail
